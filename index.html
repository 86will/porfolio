       <p>This Comic Book was created by 3 friends who served together at Fort Drum, NY. I [Brandon Williams] came up with the idea in 2015 but did't get it sarted until 2019.
    Myself, Martiruous Cole & Wal Flores camae together and put the Master Piece you see above together to give the world what it's been needing.
